Tactic: leadingNonzeroCalc xs'_narg
is either Left ..., w/c we can use to show absurdity using the assumption
	lnzcEq,
or is Right (FS t ** u)
for some (t). Namely, being Right (FZ ** u') is absurd, as then

	leadingNonzeroCalc $ 0::xs_narg = Right (FZ ** u'),

w/c implies

	Not ((0::xs_narg)_FZ = 0)

by indexMapEq/Chariz.

Furthermore,

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs'_narg

is either Left ...

or some t
& proof
	leadingNonzeroCalc xs'_narg = Right (FS t ** u)
& that
some v, & proof
	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (t ** v)

Given this,

we can apply

	echxs xs narg : echTy xs narg

to the

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (t ** v)

converted to

	Not (leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Left _)

to deduce the (downAndNotRightOfEntryImpliesZ xs narg _) value of the (echTy xs narg)

Hooraaay!

This completes the proof of (redEchToRight).

What can we construct from this again?

> claim redEchToRight (pech : echTy xs narg) -> (t : _) -> (v : _) -> (ech2RlnzcEq : leadingNonzeroCalc $ index narg xs = Right (t ** v)) -> (indEchRight : _ ** downAndNotRightOfEntryImpliesZ xs narg indEchRight)
> unfocus

claim 
let kappa = redEchToRight _ _ _
let indEchRight = getWitness kappa
let sundry = the (danrz xs narg indEchRight) getProof kappa

What... willl......

I feel like (indEchRight) should actually be equal to the argument (t) if
we're going to get any work out of this proof. I mean, that seems like the actual application of the (pech) argument to construct.

We could've used

	extractEchAltStep2 xs (some rowEchelon xs) narg

instead of

	extractEchAlt xs narg pech

to have it extract specifically that (echxs narg) is the danrz computed.

That doesn't seem to be the goal, directly at least.

---

I think what we need to prove is

1) Given
	someNonZnessNel = FS leadeln
2) Given a proof this implies
	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (leadeln ** _)
3) Given our separate proof that
	danrz xs narg indEchRight
constructed from the (redEchToRight) lemma proved above

We can prove (indEchRight = leadeln), which proves the goal by rewriting (3).
I claim we can:

Strategy:
Note that in the context of the proof of (redEchToRight) we can actually show
the (danrz) is equal to (echxs narg) if we use that as its (pech) argument.

Hence, if we know that (echxs narg) produces a (danrz xs narg indEchRight)
WITH (lnzc xs_narg)'S INNER WITNESS AS (indEchRight), then we know from (2)
that (indEchRight = leadeln).

Situation 1)

We extract

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (indEchRight ** _)

from (echxs narg = Right _) as shown in the context of the proof of (redEchToRight).

We can then (trans) with the characterization of (someNonZnessNel = FS leadeln)
as the implication

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (leadeln ** _)

to obtain the full proof of (echReduce1) (for this pattern).

Situation 2)

We're not able to extract the (indEchRight) of (echxs narg) satisfying

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (indEchRight ** _),

so we're unable to produce the goal with the first technique.

In that event, we write (extractEchAlt) anew so that it proves, rather than an
equality with the value of the (echTy xs narg), that for the (danrz xs narg indEchRight)
it produces, (indEchRight) satisfies

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (indEchRight ** _).

From this we can (trans) with the characterization of (someNonZnessNel = FS leadeln)
as the implication

	leadingNonzeroCalc xs_narg = Right (leadeln ** _)

to prove (echReduce1) (for this pattern).
